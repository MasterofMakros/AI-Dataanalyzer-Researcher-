# Execute Phase

**Step 1: Check Plan**
Ensure you have an approved plan in `.agents/plans/`.

**Step 2: Implement**
- Make code changes strictly following the plan.
- If you encounter a surprise (`Wait, this architecture is different...`), **STOP**, update the Plan, and ask for re-approval.

**Step 3: Iteration**
- Use small steps.
- Create files, run simple tests if possible.

**Step 4: Completion**
When implementation is done, proceed immediately to the **Validate** phase.
