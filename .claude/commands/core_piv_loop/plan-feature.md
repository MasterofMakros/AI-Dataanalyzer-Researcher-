# Plan Phase

**Step 1: Check Input**
Ensure you have a Feature Request (e.g. `INITIAL.md` or clear instruction).

**Step 2: Create PRP**
Run `/generate-prp` (or manually create `PRPs/<slug>.md` from template).
The Plan MUST include:
- Files to be modified.
- Validation Gates to be passed.
- Rollback strategy.

**Step 3: Review**
Present the PRP to the User.
**Wait for approval.**
