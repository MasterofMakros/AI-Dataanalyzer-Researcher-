# Create PRD

**Step 1: Check Hierarchy**
- Is this a "North Star" change? Update `docs/prd/00_conductor_prd.md`.
- Is this a new Feature? Create `docs/prd/[ID]_feature_name.md`.

**Step 2: PRD Content**
- **Draft** the PRD based on user conversation.
- **Goal:** What are we building?
- **Success Metrics:** How do we know it works?
- **Constraints:** Performance, Tech Stack.

**Step 3: Review**
- Ask user for approval before moving to **Plan** phase.
