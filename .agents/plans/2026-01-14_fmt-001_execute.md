# EXECUTE Report: PRP-FMT-001 (E2E Format Harness)
Date: 2026-01-14

## Changes Implemented
- Added `scripts/e2e_formats.py` harness with CLI, exit codes, and JSON/MD reporting.
- Added thin wrappers `scripts/e2e_formats.sh` and `scripts/e2e_formats.ps1`.
- Added minimal sample set under `data/samples/` (text/email + overlay-only).
- Added runbook `docs/dev/e2e-testing.md`.
- Hardened retrieval assertions to a tiered stack (strong/medium/weak) to avoid false negatives.

## Notes
- Binary samples (pdf/docx/xlsx) are generated on-demand by the harness if missing.
- No changes to `smart_ingest.py` or `file_indexer.py`.

## Tests
- Not run (Docker daemon not verified in this session).
