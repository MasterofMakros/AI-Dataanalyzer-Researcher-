# EXECUTE Report — PRP-UI-002 (Perplexica UI E2E)
Date: 2026-01-15

## Changes Implemented
- Added Playwright config and E2E specs under `ui/perplexica/tests/e2e`.
- Added `data-testid` selectors across chat inputs, results list, sources panels, and preview modals.
- Added format icon rendering to local document cards and tagged format icons for tests.
- Added UI E2E runbook at `docs/dev/ui-e2e-testing.md`.

## Notes
- `package.json` updated with Playwright scripts and devDependencies.
- `npm install` could not run in this environment (Node.js not available / WSL1 error), so `package-lock.json` was not updated.

## Tests
- Not run (Node/npm unavailable in this environment).
